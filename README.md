# Krystal Klear Aquariums
This is an app/website made to help a guy who has an aquarium cleaning and installment business. the website serves as his business official website and has a homepage, contact, and services page. Anyone who visits the site has the ability to contact the business owner and make an inquiry for a purchase of services. 
On the back end of the website is a seperate "app" specifically for the business owner. Here he/she logs in using their registered information. Once logged on they can see a list of all the clients they've had. The clients name, phone, email, services purchased, and more, is viewable here. they also have to ability to manage emails, and set any client as an acitve or non-active customer.
